The French Revolution was a period of social and political upheaval in France and its colonies beginning in 1789 and ending in 1799. The Revolution overthrew the monarchy; established a republic; catalyzed violent periods of political turmoil; and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon, who brought many of the revolution's principles to areas he conquered in Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas such as equality before the law, the Revolution influenced the decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies.[1]

Comparisons to the earlier American Revolution were first made in 1800 by conservative reactionary Friedrich von Gentz.[2] The 1789 National Assembly was initially dominated by aristocrats like Lafayette, who idealised the American Patriot cause; the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was based on the US Declaration of Independence.[3] However, since the causes of the French Revolution were very different, the solutions proposed became far more radical, and the nobility was quickly superseded.

Between 1700 to 1789, the French population increased from 18 million to 26 million, leading to large numbers of unemployed.[4] High levels of state debt, incurred during the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War, [5] required increases in taxes, borne disproportionately by the lower classes. This was accompanied by sharp rises in food prices caused by years of bad harvests, worsened by deregulation of the grain industry and fifty consecutive days of below-freezing temperatures in the winter of 1788-1789.

The result was widespread resentment at the privileges enjoyed by the French aristocracy and the Catholic clergy; underpinned by Enlightenment ideals on democracy, it led to the convocation of the Estates General in May 1789. In June, members of the Third Estate, or commoners, took control of the Assembly, followed by the Storming of the Bastille in July, the symbol of Royal authority. One of the most important reforms was the abolition of feudalism in August, as well as rules and privileges left over from the Ancien Regime. In a demonstration of popular power, the October Women's March on Versailles forced the royal court back to Paris.

The next few years featured political struggles between various liberal assemblies and supporters of the monarchy intent on thwarting major reforms, promoted by the Jacobins, led to the Insurrection of 10 August 1792 and the arrest of Louis XVI and the royal family. The Republic was proclaimed in 22 September after the first French elections and the victory at Valmy. Its goal was to unify France and to introduce the same taxes and democratic elections for more citizens. It opposed prerogatives. In a momentous event that led to international condemnation and an internal struggle in the Convention between the Girondins and Montagnards, Louis XVI was executed in January 1793.

External threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution. The French Revolutionary Wars unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East. Internally, popular agitation by the Sans-culottes radicalised the Revolution significantly, followed by the Insurrection at the end of May, and the rise of Maximilien Robespierre.
